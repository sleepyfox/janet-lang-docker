# Usage

Download the janet language release from [here](https://github.com/janet-lang/janet/releases). Now unzip and untar it with:

> $ tar zxvf janet-vx.x.x-targetos.tar.gz

You can now build a Docker runtime container image with: `make build` and bring up a repl with: `make repl`.
To quit from the repl use ^d or `(os/exit)`.
